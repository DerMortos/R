>**Objective:** One-Way ANOVA

---


### Problems:
For a one-way ANOVA problem, where we consider one factor with $a$ levels and
$n$ replicates ($N=na$). Assume the standard effect model $y_{ij}=\mu + \tau_i + \epsilon_{ij},$ where $\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2).$

* Show that
$$\sum_{i=1}^a \sum_{j=1}^n (y_{ij} - \bar{y}_{..})^2 = n\sum_{i=1}^a (\bar{y}_{i.}- \bar{y}_{..})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^a \sum_{j=1}^n (y_{ij} - \bar{y}_{i.})^2$$. \

* Show that 
$$SS_T = \sum_{i=1}^a \sum_{j=1}^n (y_{ij} - \bar{y}_{..})^2 = \sum_{i=1}^a \sum_{j=1}^ny_{ij}^2 - \frac{y_{..}^2}{N}$$ \

* Show that 
$$SS_{Treatments} = n\sum_{i=1}^a (\bar{y}_{i.}- \bar{y}_{..})^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^a y_{i.}^2 - \frac{y_{..}^2}{N}$$

* Show that
$$E(MS_E) = \sigma^2$$ \

* Show that
$$E(MS_{Treatments}) = \sigma^2 + \frac{n}{a-1} \sum_{i=1}^a \tau_i^2$$ \
![Problem 5](Hw7-5.png)

* To compare the teaching effectiveness of 3 teaching methods, the semester average based on 4 mid-term exams from five randomly selected students enrolled in each teaching method were used.
    * **What is the response in this study?** \
    4 midterms \
    * **How many replicates are there?** \
    5 \
    * **Write the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses.** \
    $H_0$: all averages are equal \
    $H_a$: at least one average is not equal \
    * **Complete the partially filled ANOVA table given below. Round your answers to 4 decimal places** \
        pf(14.6853,2,12, lower.tail = FALSE)
    
        Source          | df  | SS  | MS     | F   | P-value |
        ---             | --- | --- | ---    | --- | ---     |
        Teaching Method |  2  | 245 |122.5000|14.6852|  0.0006    |
        Error           | 12  |100.1| 8.3417 | -   | -       |
        Total           | 14  |345.1|  -     | -   | -       |
                        |     |     |        |     |         |
    * **Find the critical value at $\alpha=0.01$** \
    From appendix IV $F_{2,12,0.01}$ = 6.93 \
    * **Make your conclusion** \
    With a small P-value we reject the null. Therefor at least one teaching method differs in effectiveness.
